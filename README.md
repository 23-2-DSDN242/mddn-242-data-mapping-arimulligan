# Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

## The Complexity of Connection

### Artists Concept

This data mapping design demonstrates the need for human relationships, emphasizing how community helps all things mental health and the depression of isolating yourself from this. The people portrayed in this piece bear the mark of a red filter, symbolizing the passionate, sometimes irrational, and often intense nature of individual thoughts and actions. On top of this filter are swirls, showing that when we live in isolation, our minds can turn to chaotic thoughts, or when we refuse help from others, can turn into a string of chaotic actions.  
Yet, the warm, inviting yellow filter surrounding these individuals present a contrasting narrative. This radiant hue represents the comforting embrace of human connection. When we surround ourselves with others, we find solace in the shared experiences, support, and sense of belonging. It is in the company of our fellow beings that we discover the calmness and warmth, shown through putting no extra effects in this area apart from the filter. The marble-like texture and greenish filter on the background exhibits and the awe-inspiring beauty and potential danger of nature's own disorderly patterns. It serves as a reminder that, while nature can be breathtaking in its own swirling way, it can also be unforgiving, even deadly if one ventures alone.

The Complexity of Connection encourages reflection on the interplay of isolation and community in our lives. It underscores the dichotomy of human existence: the brilliance of individuality and the serenity found in the embrace of a vibrant, interconnected society.

### Design Journal 
**Initial Ideas:**

I want to do something with people, as I have a lot of photos with my friends and I, and I want to convey that having a good set of friends is vital for a happy life in my opinion. So I've put three photos into the AI, with the respective masks which I made online [![here]]. I got an expected output, so the AI knows how to tell people apart from objects in photos!

**Theme:**

I decided to create a soft, block-style colour theme, with warmer hues around people and then colder hues around nature and not near people, to show that everyone gets a nice warm coloured fuzzy feeling when you're having a good time with mates, but you feel a colder coloured vibe when you feel lonely.
To start off with, I thought the idea of 'patchwork of people' would be a cool title, and then I would try to mimic a mosiac artwork, made with broken pieces of the image. However, as the lessons on making custom pixels went on, I found out that there's so many more filters and different things you can do to change the image!

**Training:**

I brought in three new images, this time with several groups of people in the photos, as I wanted to see if it recognised other people in the background or just one group of people. The output I got was positive, as it captured most of the people in the background. There was one photo which the AI didn't catch a person lying down far away, but I decided I liked it like that because I wanted to highlight people who were in community or in groups, and that man was sunbathing by himself (which meant he could have the colder filter applied to him, because he was alone).

**Drawing Techniques:**

I firstly tried using the p5js line and circle and rectangles to create a paintbrush effect on both the people and the background. I experimented aroud with it and it looked pretty nice, but it wasn't the intended output I was going for. Then I tried using the 'wavy' effect in the background to give the background areas a fuzzy, chaotic feeling that you get when you're in nature (or the beach in this case). I then created a function which could change the pixel colours after the wave had been calculated, so that I could create my warm and cold hues on the white and black areas on my image according to the mask. 
Seeing that we could change each pixel according to the pixels around it, I copied the bokeh effect from the class lessons and thought that would be a great way to give the people in my images privacy and so that anyone can relate to my images (as people blurred out don't have any marking characteristics) and believe that the group of people shown could be them and their friends. 
I then found out that I could apply a second layer of p5js shapes ontop of the new pixels created, so I firstly just created a random amount of rectangles with the same colour as the pixel that it is drawn on, so the photo looked a little glitchy-like.
After experimenting some more and asking ChatGBT, I found that I could create spirals in random places on the image, which went well with the naturesque background. After a while, I decided that putting it on the people looked very interesting, and it could represent the swirling inner thoughts that some people have, when you are with people, but you still feel alone. Disconnected.
After seeing the texture image effect, I decided to delete the wavy effect and apply that to the background instead, so that the grass could be seen properly (the wavy effect does not pair well with fine deatils like grass). The image I used was a marble background. 

**Final Images:**

The colours I applied to the people I wanted to change and give it more of the block-style theme, so I made an area around the groups of people which would be warm and yellow-ish coloured, with no other filters, to show the non-haywire vibe of being with people. I then made the actual people have a more redish filter, which emphasised the swirls on them. To finalise the images, I decided to also apply a green-blueish filter to the background. This meant that the images had three main colours popping out: yellow, red and green.
